* remove all the luajittex bla bla from tex-common
* disable luajittex format in texlive-base
* move all the trigger code into update-texmf-conf
	why? how should this work?
* make distinction between trigger call and normal clal
* rewrite policy and user documentation!!!
  - all config files handling has changed!!!
  - texmf.d handling has changed, changes to /etc/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf
    are NOT USER EDITABLE ANYMORE
    exclusive use of /etc/texmf/texmf.d
