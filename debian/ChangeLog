	* Found files of unknown origin in avantgar.tfm

	* Work on pnsfss finished, started working on required font files 

2006-04-27    <frank@kuesterei.ch>

	* Wrote e-mail to amslatex upstream to clarify their license.

	* texinfo's README allows distribution "without royalty" - is this
	"no-sell"?  It's probably just ambiguous wording, "in any medium"
	should be moved away from "without royalty".

	* Added tpm files for latex-beamer, pgf and xcolor, marked xcolor
	as verified in the Catalogue.  To beamer.tpm, I added
	beamerexample-seminar.tex - whether this is free depends on the
	outcome of investigating seminar.

	* Filed bug against pgf (wrong copyright file), but it's still
	free, except maybe for some images.

	* File #364127 against latex-beamer, because I found out that
	beamer has files with unclear copyright.  Let others care for
	other's business.

	* ltxmisc.tpm is added, but the individual files have not been checked

	* Wrote an e-mail to Axel Kielhorn (the address he uses in usenet,
  	Axel.NoSpam@gmx.de, since the one in adrconv's files bounces

	* Fixed the tetex-src part of the script

	* Wrote an other mail to Lars Engebretsen, regarding ae fonts

	* tpm2licenses can now be installed and called with perl
	/usr/share/tex-common/tpm2licenses (or simply use
	dpkg-statoverride to make it executable...)

	* This file is actually a Change Log only for my copyright/license
	verification work
