tex-common (4.01) experimental; urgency=low

  * moving files from /usr/share/doc/texmf to /usr/share/texmf/doc
    when using dh_installtex:
    - please Build-depend on tex-common (>= 4.01)
    - install the files in /usr/share/texmf/doc
    no further steps are necessary, dh_installtex automatically adds
    the necessary dependencies (either >= 4 if /usr/share/texmf/doc
    is present in the package, otherwise >= 3)

tex-common (4.00) experimental; urgency=low

  * documentation file changes:
    the link from /usr/share/texmf/doc to /usr/share/doc/texmf
    is dropped. That means that the documentation of packages putting
    them into /usr/share/doc/texmf will not be found by texdoc
    anymore. Package should be rebuild with an added dependency
    on tex-common (>= 4~) and put documentation to be found by texdoc
    into /usr/share/texmf/doc (according to TDS standard), and other
    docs into /usr/share/doc/$package, but nothing into /usr/share/doc/texmf

tex-common (3.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * updmap file handling changed

    For users:
    If you are using PostScript fonts that are not packaged for 
    Debian, some changes have been done: updmap now reads *all*
    updmap.cfg files it finds. That means, the easiest way to
    activate local fonts (in TEXMFLOCAL) by putting the respective
    map lines into /usr/local/share/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg, and 
    call updmap-sys once (as root). If you have fonts in your
    home directory you want to activate, paralleling the above
    you put the respective map line into $HOME/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
    and call updmap (as user). But be reminded that you have to
    do that everytime system fonts have changed (there is no 
    automatic syncronization between user specific and system wide
    updmap(-sys) generated files).

    For developers:
    Since version 3 of tex-common, which conincides and requires
    TeX Live 2011 and upward, updmap now behaves differently then
    before: It reads *all* available updmap.cfg files. That means
    that the handling of updmap.d snippets in /etc/texmf/updmap.d
    has changed. Packages rebuild with tex-common >= 3 will not
    install anything in this directory.

    Old, especially Debian external, font packages that still use
    the old (updmap.d) mechanism are (as of 3.7) still supported,
    but with warnings. Please rebuild these packages with a newer
    tex-common.

tex-common (1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Manually reinstalling removed conffiles
  
    Due to a bug in the postrm script of tetex-base in etch, purging this
    package removes essential configuration files of texlive
    packages. tex-common is also affected, because tetex-base removed
    /etc/texmf/web2c/mktex.cnf.  This file isn't strictly needed, but it
    is very much recommended that you reinstall it.  You can find a copy
    in /usr/share/tex-common/.

tex-common (1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Filename database in $TEXMFHOME is no longer created and updated
  
    The ls-R filename database in $TEXMFHOME, $HOME/texmf, is no longer
    created in new installs, and also not updated by default.  This makes
    sense unless you have a very large number of files installed in that
    tree. 
  
    However, you MUST remove the old file $HOME/texmf/ls-R in order to
    allow TeX to find new files in that hierarchy!
   
  * Backwards compatibility hacks dropped
  
    In etch, some tools and search paths still supported obsolete paths
    and invocations.  These backwards compatibility hacks, most notably to
    the *-sys tools and font search paths, have now been dropped.

  * The parse-first-line feature is now enabled by default, in order to
    allow MetaPost to call TeX with different formats.  Only when invoked
    as "teX" it is disabled to remain Knuth-compatible.

tex-common (0.26) unstable; urgency=low
  
  * New font cache handling
  
    The font cache handling has been reworked completely.  By default, a
    separate font cache is kept for each user.  If you want to re-enable
    site-wide caching, see the instructions in README.Debian.  On systems
    where $HOME is not writable, fonts will be temporarily cached in
    /tmp/texfonts. 
  
  * Breakage with TeXLive
  
    The texlive packages as of version 2005-2 do not automatically create
    a user's TEXMFVAR directory for font caching. This might break
    document processing in some configurations. Simply create the
    directory $HOME/.texmf-var manually to fix this.
