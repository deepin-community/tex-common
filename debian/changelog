tex-common (1.15) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Norbert Preining ]
  * upload of trigger-enabled tex-common to unstable, packages should be
    rebuild. Triggers are supported for files dropped into /etc/texmf/updmap.d
    and /etc/texmf/language.d, i.e., for calls to updmap-sys
    and fmtutil-sys (when hyphenation patterns are used). If packages
    need to install fonts/hyphenation patterns and need them active
    in the postinst already, it should call dh_installtex with
      --flavor=map:notriggers
    or
      --flavor=language:notriggers
    Until all packages have been rebuilt with the new dh_installtex
    updmap-sys and fmtutil-sys will be called two times.
  * remove references to teTeX from the man pages (Closes: #486369)
  * bump dh compat level to 5, adjust debian/control
  * add ${misc:Depends} to dependencies

tex-common (1.12) experimental; urgency=low

  * bump version of tex-common packages built with dh_installtex to 1.11
    otherwise the conflict with tetex-base is not included properly. This really
    would close #467330, but due to the disappearance of  1.10 the last
    version is also sufficient [np]
  * Create empty /usr/local/share/texmf in postinst, remove in prerm if
    empty, with code taken from the Policy manual. The decision whether
    local documentation should be in the texmf tree or in
    /usr/local/share/doc and accessed via a symlink is left to the local

         explanation to fmtutil.cnf;
       - only trigger special behavior on 40jadetex.cnf, not on
         *40jadetex.cnf; same thing with 40xmltex.cnf and
         10texlive-latex-base.cnf;
       - use 0 and 1 instead of "false" and "true" for $seen_latex in order
         to be consistent with the rest of the script.

  * make proper ucfr checking in maintainer scripts (Closes: #409897) [np]
  * rework the code generated by dh_installtex in the postinst script.
    Now at postinst/configure time fmtutil-sys is called with
      --all --cnffile <file>
    where <file> are the fmt.d config files installed by the package. This
    way a dpkg-reconfigure will create *all* formats defined in the config
    file, even if the sysadm has defined additional formats.
    (Closes: #418983) [np]
  * Update snippets in texmf.d according to a reordering patch accepted

  * Fix typography in Debian-on-TeX, thanks to Miguel de Val Borro

  * In the source package, replace 'tex-sed' with a Python script named
    'texify-tex-output' to do a better job (handling all known cases so
    far, some of which seemed rather difficult to implement in sed).

    We don't need to Build-Depend on Python, because this script is only
    used when we generate PDF output from the DebianDoc documents
    (Debian-TeX-Policy, TeX-on-Debian), which we don't do at build time
    in order to avoid chicken-and-egg problems. [florent]

  * Add engine subdirectories to the search paths for MetaFont and
    MetaPost, too.  Thanks to Jörg Sommer <joerg@alea.gnuu.de>

  * Change the dh_installtex removal logic since format dumps are placed
    into engine subdirectories. We now remove all format dumps and log files
    in /v/l/t/web2c and /v/l/t/web2c/$engine/

tex-common (0.42) unstable; urgency=low

  * Documentation fixes to update-fontlang.1:
      - the .TH line was broken, causing an ugly footer in the formatted
        manpage;
      - the SYNOPSIS had an incorrect syntax ('-language', '-updmap', and
        '-fmtutil' aren't optional) and the new way is much easier to read
        anyway IMO;
      - always mention the programs in that order: update-updmap,
        update-language and update-fmtutil (reason is, I think the average
        user is more likely to need update-updmap than any of the two
        others);
      - the arguments to some options were forgotten, as in the
        update-fontlang usage message ('--help');
      - better option formatting (for those with a short and a long form;
         copied from /usr/share/man/man1/man.1.gz);
      - the default values for TEXMFCONFIG and TEXMFVAR do *not* end with
        a slash;
      - the path to TeX-on-Debian.txt.gz was wrong;
      - s/updmap.sys/updmap.cfg/;
      - s/TEMXF/TEXMF/ in a few places;
      - a package may install *several* files in each /etc/texmf/*.d
        directory (and list them in the .list files under
        /var/lib/tex-common).
      - a bit more details here and there;
      - more formatting to ease reading (such as italics), punctuation,
        typographical fixes. [florent]

  * Fix to update-fontlang: don't forget the arguments to '-c' and '-o' in
    the usage message ('--help'). [florent]

  * Minor fixes to postrm-texlsr to avoid having too long lines (greater
    than 80 characters). [florent]

  * Fix format extraction regexp in dh_installtex, the format name must

    but hyphens are allowed in the name.  Thanks Ralf. [preining]
  * dh_installtex: Include only the minimal mktexlsr code in case no other

    the ls-R DB for /usr/share/texmf and /var/lib/texmf [preining]
    (Closes: #392359)
  * Add engine-specific paths to the TEXFORMATS and TEXFONTMAPS variables,

  * Document in policy that font cache data have to be cleaned by packages
    that Build-Depend on TeX, and how to do that (closes: #388399) [frank]
  * On systems upgraded from woody to sarge, tetex-bin generated a bogus
    local configuration file with entries that were erroneously detected
    as locally changed.  These entries are now harmful and break texlive,
    and the file is therefore renamed if it meets our expectations
    (closes: #391355) [frank]
  * In 95NonPath.cnf, add a comment about how to redump the format file
    (closes: #380323) [frank]

 -- Frank Küster <frank@debian.org>  Fri,  6 Oct 2006 17:40:19 +0200

tex-common (0.30) unstable; urgency=high

  * update-fontlang:  If a conffile has a corresponding dpkg-new file,
    that is, it is from a yet-unconfigured package, drop it any case.
    Previously, the check was only done when the file had a magic comment,
    but conffiles in sarge generally do not have this magic.  Therefore,
    upgrades from sarge would have failed if the conffile change is needed for
    proper configuration (closes: #389550) [frank]
  * Remove the medium-priority debconf note without replacement; anybody
    who really runs into the problem will be able to find the information
    in tetex-bin's README.Debian (closes: #388973) [frank]

  * Add missing function and variable declarations to preinst, thanks to
    Hilmar (closes: #385532) [frank]

    to Bill Allombert <ballombe@debian.org> (closes: #388156) [frank]

    latex.fmt or other basic formats are needed [frank]

 -- Frank Küster <frank@debian.org>  Wed, 23 Aug 2006 22:09:37 +0200

tex-common (0.27) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Policy Change:  Treat configuration files properly as Debian Policy
    mandates.  The only TeX-specific addition is that we remind
    maintainers to only treat files for site-wide changes as configuration
    files, not files intended to change the typeset output on a
    per-document or per-project basis.  Consequently, mktex.cnf is now
    installed as /etc/texmf/web2c/mktex.cnf.  Thanks to Manoj Srivastava!
    This closes: #379089, a RC bug, hence the medium urgency [frank]
  * Really install NEWS.Debian about the font cache changes in the last
    upload [frank]
  * Update changelog for 0.16. We forgot to close two bugs. [hilmar-guest]
  * Debconf Translations: [frank]

tex-common (0.26) unstable; urgency=low

  * Font data are now cached separately for each user, or in /tmp/texfonts
    when there is no writable home directory.  Thus we could get rid of
    the complicated debconf questions related to that issue (there's still
    one note left) (closes: #376050, #366805, #368411).  Many thanks to
    Ralf Stubner for his "braindump".

    This change requires installation of a file in a TEXMF tree; we
    therefore run mktexlsr if it is available. [frank]

  * common.functions.in: [florent]
      + change create_tetex_formats() so that fmtutil-sys is run in a
        temporary directory; otherwise, it may use files lying in the
        current directory, which can cause bad surprises. This will close
        #377581 when propagated to the various packages using this function
        in their maintainer scripts.
      + replace `command args ...` with $(command args ...) everywhere in
        the file.

  * Updated Maintainer field to use new mailing list [jdg]

  * dhit_check_run_without_errors() in postrm-tex was not completely silent

    chroot (again closes: #354113, #366858) [frank]

  * Change the configuration scheme again a little: Before accepting a
    group name typed by the user, test whether it really exists.
    Furthermore, if there is only one user in the "normal user" range in
    /etc/passwd, suggest their group as the owner of the font cache.  And
    finally, make the wording clearer everywhere.  Many thanks to Anthony
    DeRobertis <anthony@derobert.net>, James R. Van Zandt"

  * Restore the previous behavior by making the subdirectories of

    add --quiet to the call of update-updmap in the debhelper scripts

    when invoked as update-updmap, whether /usr/share/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
    exists and abort with an explanation in that case. [florent]
  * Translations:
    - updated Danish debconf translation, thanks to Claus Hindsgaul
      <claus_h@image.dk> (closes: #332699) [frank]

tex-common (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change hyph_size to 8191 - according to DEK it should be a prime
    number.  [frank]
  * Add a (closes:...) to the last version's changelog entry to make
    tracking history easier, in fact the bug has been closed manually
    [frank].
  * fix update-texmf to not go into an endless loop when called with an
    unknown option [frank]
  * Modify postrm.in script to remove TEXMFSYSVAR and /var/cache/fonts
    (thus also removing left over files at purge time) [preining]
  * manage ls-R files using debconf [preining].  The translations have
    been copied over from tetex-bin [frank]. (Closes: #328291)
  * Let the debconf dependency be created by debhelper, thus allowing
    debconf-2.0 as an alternative [frank] (closes: #332115)
  * In fact install the pdf version of the Policy draft, but include it in
    the tar.gz file.  Thus we can drop the Build-dependency on
    tetex-extra.  A working TeX system is only needed on the developer's
    system if the policy source has been changed.

  * move old config files in /usr/share/texmf/web2c out of the way [preining]
  * remove old formats in /usr/share/texmf/web2c  (closes: #323828) [preining]

tex-common (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

    tetex-bin.
  * Move LSRS variable to common.variables

    its formats with all languages installed

tex-common (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: "tex-common: generalize TEXFONTMAPS and ENCFONTS", thanks to
    Norbert Preining and Hans Hagen (Closes: #318872).
  * language.dat is now a generated file in VARTEXMF, and the actual
    conffiles are in /etc/texmf/language.d.  This allows packages to add
    hyphenation patterns - many thanks again to Norbert.
  * Merged update-updmap and update-language into one file, and
    fixed location of memory files in update-updmap
  * Install the symlink to texmf.cnf

tex-common (0.3) unstable; urgency=low
